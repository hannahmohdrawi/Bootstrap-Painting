The column’s height and colors, and the container’s height and width, are already included in style.css. Your goal is to recreate the painting by:

    using the existing container.
    unscrambling the order of the provided columns.
    adjusting the widths of the provided columns.
    adding new rows and additional columns.
    nesting row(s) inside columns.
